# GeneticAlgorithm-DFS-Optimization

Generate an optimal daily fantasy sports lineup subject to constraints using a genetic algorithm (GA package in R)

The code can be used to for other similar knapsack optimization problems by modifying the evaluation function and the initial population. 

Use the included .csv file to run the code on a test dataset
